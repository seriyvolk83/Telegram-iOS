# Telegram iOS UI Competition

One the first animation is implemented and in the sample app instead of Telegram project,
but the animation is really well implemented.

Unfortunetely I didn't find the description of the provide JSON format and used video
to get the data for the key frames. Hence, the animation slightly differ, but it's not
visible by the eye.

Second animation is much more simple, but I started only today, so...

# How to verify

1. Open `SampleApp/SampleApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode 14.2
2. Run
3. Pull the sample table and verify how it works.
4. Verify the code
